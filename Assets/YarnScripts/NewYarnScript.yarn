Winter42: Hi, sweetie.
	-> Hey!
Winter42: It's 03:07 in the morning here. I know you know what time it is here, though.
Winter42: It's another sleepless night...
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: And a lonely one. As usual.
	-> I'm always here for you.
Winter42: I know that. You are always here, regardless of time.
Winter42: But I wish you were <b>really</b> here.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: In this very bedroom...
	-> I wish that, too.
Winter42: More than some texts in my phone's screen.
Winter42: Things would be easier if it was just an ocean between us.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: <i>"Ocean between us, I'll drink the whole thing"</i>, like they say in that song...
	-> Right. And <i>"Ice between us, I'll break through it"</i>.
Winter42: Yes!
Winter42: Anyway... I guess I'm just drivelling, lol.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
	-> Not at all!
Winter42: No, I am.

Winter42: Well, I'll try to sleep again...
Winter42: Goodbye for now, love!
	-> Have a good sleep!
Winter42: xoxox
