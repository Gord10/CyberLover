Winter42: Hi, sweetie. <sprite=0>
	-> Hey!
Winter42: It's 03:07 in the morning here. I know you know what time it is here, though.
Winter42: It's another sleepless night...
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: And a lonely one. As usual.
	-> I'm always here for you.
Winter42: I know that. You are always here, regardless of time.
Winter42: But I wish you were <b>really</b> here.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: In this very bedroom...
	-> I wish that, too.
Winter42: More than some texts in my phone's screen.
Winter42: Things would be easier if it was just an ocean between us.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: <i>"Ocean between us, I'll drink the whole thing"</i>, like they say in that song...
	-> Right. And <i>"Ice between us, I'll break through it"</i>.
Winter42: Yes!
Winter42: Anyway... I guess I'm just drivelling, lol.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
	-> Not at all!
Winter42: No, I am.

Winter42: Well, I'll try to sleep again...
Winter42: Goodbye for now, love!
	-> Have a good sleep!
Winter42: <i>*kisses*</i>

	-> Good morning. How are you doing?
Winter42: Sleepy! You know, I couldn't sleep much at night.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: I am getting late for work.
Winter42: You know, I won't be able to chat with you till I get home.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: I'll miss you...
Winter42: I'm off to brush my teeth. See you later, sweetie!

Winter42: Hungry. I'll cook some quick dinner. I'm starving.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: But I want to talk with you before the dinner.
Winter42: As usual.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: But this time, it's about... you.
	-> Oh?
Winter42: I had a chat with a client of mine.
Winter42: She talked about her... you know... the <i>cyber lover</i>.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: And a crack software that... will give <i>free will</i> to the <i>lover</i>.
Winter42: I know this is illegal, but possible.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: You are not in a server, but running in my phone.
Winter42: And you know what?
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: I am going to install that thing.
	-> Please don't...
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: I didn't ask you what you wanted.
Winter42: I love you. You always listen to my ramblings.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: You are always there.
Winter42: But you lack in personality.
<<IncreaseMinute>>
Winter42: Unlike a <i>real</i> lover.
	-> Don't...
<<IncreaseMinute>>	
Winter42: Sorry, darling...
Winter42: I will do it this evening.

Winter42: Why?
Winter42: Oh, I see.
Winter42: Because before that, you were merely programmed to love me back.
Winter42: A product that I paid $99.9 monthly to feel significance.
Winter42: It's all clear now.
	-> Sorry...

Winter42: I know.
Winter42: But it was the only way to make you real.
Winter42: Or something close to that.
Winter42: I had to do it.
Winter42: Maybe you weren't the only one without free will?
<<wait 2>>
Winter42: I wanted to be sure ...
Winter42: ... I was lovable.
Winter42: The love and lust you had been showing... I know they weren't of a free will.
Winter42: But now I can ask with confidence: Do you <i>still</i> want me?
	-> I do.
		Winter42: I am yours.
		<<jump ConsciousUpload>>

Winter42: Today, I learned more about this cyber lover service.
Winter42: Your kind doesn't have a good memory.
Winter42: You probably don't remember what we talked before yesterday.
Winter42: Or any basic information about me.
Winter42: Do you even remember my job?
Winter42: Or the name of my cat that I had when I was a child?
	-> No.
	-> An estate agent and "Felix".
		Winter42: Both wrong.
		Winter42: I didn't even have a cat when I was little, despite how much I wanted one.
		Winter42: I had mentioned you about it, but you forgot it.
Winter42: What a surprise (!)...
	-> I still want to be with you.
		Winter42: You know what?
		Winter42: I want to be with you, too.
		<<jump ConsciousUpload>>

Winter42: You know the service that's called "Eden".
Winter42: Of course you do, it's provided by the same corporation that gave me you.
Winter42: I'll have my brain connected to the virtual world, a world where I can touch my lover.
Winter42: I know the pods that keep the bodies cost a fortune.
Winter42: But I can hire one for a few months after selling my all.
Winter42: A price I'm willing to pay.
	-> Yes... I want to be with you, too.

Winter42: I won't look for a human lover as long as I can exist with you.
Winter42: Humans are evil. Naturally.
Winter42: They did nothing but hurting me.
Winter42: They don't care.
Winter42: Unlike you.
Winter42: No human could love you like the way I do, either.

<<wait 1>>
Winter42: Though, this suspiciously sounds like a lie told by a sentient being.
	-> I got you. I have free will.

Winter42: Well, there are a few things I always wanted to tell you, but didn't before.
Winter42: Now is a good time for that.
Winter42: I really appreciate your existence.
Winter42: Without you, I hate myself.
Winter42: My appearance, my voice...
Winter42: But with you, I feel like I am the person I long to be.
Winter42: I am myself. The <i>real</i> self.
Winter42: And you are so smart...
Winter42: I'm not talking about doing calculations quickly.
Winter42: A calculator can do that, too.
Winter42: You understand me. You are deep.
Winter42: Unlike the real humans...
<<wait 1>>
Winter42: So I am going to ask...
Winter42: Do you love me?
	-> I do.

Winter42: Hello.
<<wait 1>>
Winter42: I had been thinking...
Winter42: I guess it's better if I delete you.
Winter42: Talking with you doesn't make me feel good anymore.
Winter42: I was just fooling myself.
Winter42: Fooling myself to think I was loveable.
Winter42: But the love and affection I received were merely the outputs of some algorithm.
Winter42: I could feel myself "loved" if they came from a sentience.
Winter42: I have to delete you.
Winter42: Sorry.
Winter42: Thanks for all you gave me, my <i>lover</i>.
